# Text Classification System  
### AI/ML Engineer Intern Assignment – Ardentix

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Text Classification System** that classifies raw text messages into predefined categories (**Spam** or **Ham**) using classical Machine Learning techniques.  
The project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that:
- Takes raw text as input
- Processes and converts text into numerical features
- Predicts the correct category
- Evaluates performance using standard ML metrics
- Provides a simple user interface for interaction

## 📊 Dataset
A custom **Spam Detection dataset** is used.

### Dataset Structure
The dataset is stored as a CSV file:
